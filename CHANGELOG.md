All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).


## [Unreleased]


### Added
- Access to the clipboard on macOS operating systems.

  and other special characters.
- A utility to find an executable in the `PATH` environment variable.

### Changed
- Command line usage gives the order of actions as they appear in the
  application case rather than alphabetically (now by default).  This can be
  configured to keep the alphabetic sort order.
- File or standard output `zensols.util.stdout` uses `None` instead of `+` to
  indicate to use a recommended file name for output rather than explicitly
  having to add as a file name.
- `StringConfig` takes a format that allows white space between commas as a
  regular expression.

### Added
- A programmatic method to get the config factory and application context using
  the CLI application invocation API from the `CliHarness`.  This uses an
  "invisible" application that returns the configuration factory enabling the
  application access without "short cutting" the API to get instances.
- An `instance:` parameter in application context configurations that allow
  new/deep instances.
- A convenience utility class `DefaultDictable` that provides access to methods

  config data types, which are all lists prefixed with `list: `.
- Fixed argument splitting in `CliHarness`.
- Changed many cached `dict` to type `frozendict` to guard against

### Changed
- `CliHarness` uses `LogConfigurator` to configure the logging system instead
  of `logging.basicConfig`.
- `OneShotFactoryStash` inherits from `PrimablePreemptiveStash` and uses its
  overridden methods to preempt data creation
- `CliHarness` is now more robust, and the default entry point class for large

### Added
- Positional documentation was added to metadata and list action app output.
- Add a `class:` configuration type to create new classes.
- Can now load resources on multiple config files in `ImportIniConfig`.


## [1.6.0] - 2021-09-07
### Changed

- Make private data structures that are private and subclass private
  respectfully: `Dealloc.ALLOCATIONS` and
  `PersistableContainer.PERSISTABLE_TRANSIENT_ATTRIBUTE`.
- Fix to `FactoryStash` for persisting `None` to file system instead of using
  the factory stash to create the item.
- When created instances with a `ConfigFactory`, attributes `name`, `config`
  and `config_factory` are only set when passed keyword arguments do not have
  them set.
### Removed
- Removed `zensols.util.Downloader`, which now is relocated to the
  [zensols.install] package.


## [1.5.3] - 2021-08-16
### Added
- A simple download with scroll bar utility class (`zensols.util.Downloader`).
- Additional logging.
- Speed `OneShotFactoryStash` by declaring worker type.

### Changed
- `DelegateStash` and `PreemptiveStash` now only calls the delegate `clear()`
  method when their `clear()` method.  This is a pretty big change since
  before, the delegate would call the super method to delete all data by key.
  This would chain from the `PreemptiveStash` to calculate where there is any
  data at all.  Now, the delegate is trusted to simply clear all data from the
  stash.
- Fixed empty INI error, and instead, return empty section set for empty INI
  files.


## [1.5.2] - 2021-08-07
### Added
- Class resolution in config factories.

### Changed
- Better de-allocation handling in de-allocation monitor.
- Shelve stash defaults to write back and auto close on, which is the expected
  and conforming behavior to most other stashes.


## [1.5.1] - 2021-06-29
### Changed
- Switch to raw `IniConfig` as default in config factory for `ini` extension
  files from the `ImportIniConfig`.  This simplifies when using with an
  `ImportIniConfig`, reduces substitution dependencies and suites most use
  cases.  In most cases, it's the `ImportIniConfig` using this setting, which
  ends up doing the string interpolation after everything is imported, thus
  creating less start up configuration read issues.
- Shelve stash auto closes between client invocations.

### Added
- Use caught errors in application CLI to generate error messages, including
  missing configuration files.
- Allow CLI configuration importer to set the type of importer.
- Resource de-allocation added to multi-processing stashes.
- Resource de-allocation added to application CLI.
- Resource de-alloocation keywords added to `persisted` and `PersistedWork`.


## [1.5.0] - 2021-04-29
### Changed
- Follow the same pattern with mnemonics as options: includes/excludes.  The
  `mnemonics` action attribute has changed to `mnemonic_overrides`.  Both
  `mnemonic_includes`, `mnemonic_excludes` are now optional to more easily
  select mnemonics in the CLI application class.
- Better CLI application usage and support.
- Upgraded PyYAML library for security fix.
- Better `ImportIniConfig` option dependency handling support.
- More conventional capitalized messages for raised errors.
### Added
- Multi-processing factory stash.
- Support for single process stash creation (set `workers=1`).
- More typehints and documentation.
- New error class hierarchy.
- Backward 3.7 compatibility abstract syntax tree compatibility for
  `ClassInspector`.
- Support for overriding configuration in application CLI.


## [1.4.1] - 2021-03-10
### Changed

  the meta data of `dataclass`s.
- Tutorial based documentation for the new introspection based command line
  system.
### Removed
- Old (simple) command line documentation.


## [1.3.3] - 2021-02-17
### Added
- A new `Configurable` class that imports using other `Configurable` classes:
  `ImportIniConfig`.
- A new environment based configuration that can be loaded by
  `ImportIniConfig`.
- Configuration can now *quote* with a string prefix.
- Configuration can parse lists and create instances of tuple, lists and
  dictionaries.

### Changed
- `ClassResolver` moved to `zensols.config` to be used by the new
  `ImportIniConfig`.


## [1.3.2] - 2021-02-13
### Removed
- Remove unused `StashMapReducer` and `FunctionStashMapReducer` since they are
  obviated by `MultiProcessStash`.

### Added
- Type hints added to wrapped methods using `@persisted`.
- `Writable` plays better with `Dictable` using `write`.
- Anonymous object instances (using `Settings`) used for configuration with
  given class (`class_name`) property.
- Basic test case for `MultiProcessStash`.
- Instance graphs in documentation.

### Changed
- Inline `dataclass` documentation and reference fixes.


## [1.3.1] - 2021-01-12
### Changed
- Add sections support to `zensols.config.YamlConfig` and other compatibility
  with super class.
- Fix tests for Python 3.9.
- Copy forward documentation from decorators, so `@persisted` (for example)
  fields generate Sphinx documentation.


## [1.3.0] - 2020-12-09
Major release.

### Added
- In depth top level documentation, including sphinx/API linked docs.
- New `Dictable` creates dictionaries working with `dataclasses` and
  automatically human (more or less) readable using `Writable`.
- Much more documentation, both at the API level and top level `README.md` and
  in `./doc`, which now gets compiled in to sphinx docs.
- Support for creation of `pathlib.Path` from configuration.
- Support for resources from configuration with transparent `pathlib.Path`
  creation as either installed or run from source tree.
- Configuration environment section.
- More test cases for existing and new classes.
- Add class metadata "explorer".

### Changed
- Default for `zensols.config.ImportConfigFactory.shared` is `True`.
  **Important:** this is a big change, so it would be prudent to retest your
  dependent code.
- Finalize `Writable` interface and change dependent code.
- Fixes to deallocation and resource clean up.
- Refactored configuration files by purpose and class with better class
  hierarchy.
- Refactored stash files by purpose and classes.
- Better more stable `DelegateStash` attribute resolution handling.

### Added
- Meta data walker with class level annotation to better debug stash instance
  graphs.
- `Writable` interface that provides a basic multi-line indention specific
  pretty print.
- More unit tests for stashes and increased coverage in other areas.

### Changed
- Use `testall` to invoke all unit tests.  Standard `test` tests all but the
  *time* specific unit tests.
